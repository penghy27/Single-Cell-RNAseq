# Single-Cell-RNAseq

The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE276251. It consists of control and high glucose-treated zebrafishes. The tasks are as follows:

1. Filter out low-quality cells.
2. Perform clustering analysis on both datasets (no need to annotate cells). 
3. Integrate the control and high glucose-treated datasets. 
4. Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the control and treated zebrafishes for each cell cluster (0, 1, 2, etc.)
