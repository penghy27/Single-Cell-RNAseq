# Zebrafish Embryo scRNA-seq Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an R Markdown (RMD) file designed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of zebrafish embryos under control and high-glucose conditions. The primary goal is to investigate the transcriptomic effects of a high-glucose environment on embryonic development, leveraging data from the GEO dataset GSE276251. The analysis is performed using the Seurat v5 package in R, following a standard scRNA-seq workflow with modern enhancements like SCTransform for normalization and integration.

## Analysis Workflow
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Quality Control (QC)
3. Normalization and Integration
4. Dimensionality Reduction
5. Clustering
6. Differential Expression Analysis
7. Cell Type Annotation
